      <strong>Melopita: The Soul of Greek Sweets</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This traditional Greek honey cake, often called Melopita, is a masterclass
      in rustic elegance. Unlike dense, spiced Northern European honey cakes,
      the Greek version is often celebrated for its syrupy, moist crumb and
      bright Mediterranean flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It typically features a base of semolina or almond flour, which gives the
      cake a distinct, slightly grainy texture that perfectly captures and holds
      onto a luscious honey soak.

      <strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <strong> Texture:</strong>
          Incredibly moist and tender, thanks to a generous dousing of honey
          syrup immediately after baking.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong> Flavor Profile:</strong>
          A fragrant blend of high-quality Thyme honey, zesty orange peel, and
          warm cinnamon.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong> Toppings:</strong>
          Usually finished with a crunch of toasted walnuts or a simple dusting
          of ground cinnamon.
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <strong> Variations:</strong>
          Depending on the region (like Sifnos), you might find versions made
          with fresh myzithra (ricotta-style) cheese, resulting in a texture
          that sits somewhere between a sponge cake and a cheesecake.
        </ul>
