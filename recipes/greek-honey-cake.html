    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Melopita: The Soul of Greek Sweets</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      This traditional Greek honey cake, often called Melopita, is a masterclass
      in rustic elegance. Unlike dense, spiced Northern European honey cakes,
      the Greek version is often celebrated for its syrupy, moist crumb and
      bright Mediterranean flavors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It typically features a base of semolina or almond flour, which gives the
      cake a distinct, slightly grainy texture that perfectly captures and holds
      onto a luscious honey soak.

      <strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Texture:</strong>
          Incredibly moist and tender, thanks to a generous dousing of honey
          syrup immediately after baking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Flavor Profile:</strong>
          A fragrant blend of high-quality Thyme honey, zesty orange peel, and
          warm cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Toppings:</strong>
          Usually finished with a crunch of toasted walnuts or a simple dusting
          of ground cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Variations:</strong>
          Depending on the region (like Sifnos), you might find versions made
          with fresh myzithra (ricotta-style) cheese, resulting in a texture
          that sits somewhere between a sponge cake and a cheesecake.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer
          and cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook for
          2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a
          9-inch square baking pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a
          bowl; set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until
          light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour mixture,
          alternating with milk, beating just until incorporated; stir in
          walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center
          comes out clean, about 40 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a
          toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup over cake. For best
          results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup
          before slicing and serving.
        </p>
